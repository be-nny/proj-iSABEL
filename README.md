<!-- How To Play  -->
## How To Play

Start by following the instructions to log in or sign up. If the user forgets their password at any point, they can
follow the Forgot Password link, where instructions for resetting their password are sent via email.
Once logged in, the user will be taken to the Scan page, which has a camera, a report button, and the users
receipt list. The user will start by scanning the barcodes of their items, and these will appear in the receipt list box
below. Once the user encounters a bin, the user should scan the QR code on the bin. In doing so, this will give the
user the corresponding XP for each item in their receipt list.
The user can repeat this process which will increase the users level and total score on the leader-board. With
the newly gain XP, the user can use this to redeem rewards in the rewards tab which can include discounts around
campus at the University of Exeter.
